# tecplot-binary-files
Generate binary format input files for tecplot by fortran.

# A simple example

```Fortran
! use tecplot module
use tecplot

! define a tecplot object
type(tecplot_time_file) :: plt_file
integer,allocatable :: locations(:)
integer,allocatable :: type_list(:)
integer,allocatable :: shared_list(:)
integer,parameter :: num_of_variables = 6
integer :: nx,ny,nz
character(len=50) :: filename='test.plt'
real(kind=4),allocatable :: your_datas(:,:,:,:)
real(kind=4) :: physics_time

allocate(your_datas(nx,ny,nz,num_of_variables))
allocate(locations(num_of_variables))
allocate(type_list(num_of_variables))
allocate(shared_list(num_of_variables))

! locations = 0 means data in node, 1 means data in cell(not supported yet)
locations = 0
! shared_list(i)=-1 means the i-th data is not shared in this zone. If shared_list(i)=m, 
! it means the i-th data is shared with zone m in this file
shared_list = -1
! type_list(i) = 0 means the i-th data is of type float. (Other data type not supported yet.)
type_list = 1

! call init subroutine first
! nx, ny, nz means the dimension of the data
! 'x,y,z,u,v,w' is a string contains names of variables, must be divided by ','
call plt_file%init(filename,nx,ny,nz,'Tecplot File Title','x,y,z,u,v,w')

! for each zone, call the two subroutines
! physics_time can be any value, it will only be used when there are more than 1 zone in a file.
call plt_file%write_zone_header('zone name', physics_time, 0, locations) 
! your_datas(:,:,:,1:3) =  x,y,z coordinates(Variable assignment is omitted in this example)
! your_datas(:,:,:,4:6) =  u,v,w datas (Variable assignment is omitted in this example)
! ALL datas are stored in sequence like (((x(ix,iy,iz),ix=1,nx),iy=1,ny),iz=1,nz)
call plt_file%write_zone_data(type_list, shared_list, your_datas)

! before exit, you must call complete subroutine
call plt_file%complete
```

To test the code with the above example, just type the following two lines of command in terminal and check out the result `test.plt` with tecplot or paraview:
```
$ make
$ ./a.out
```
 
# Notice
1. Only float data format is supported now.
2. All subroutiens must be called in sequences.
3. There can be more than 1 write_zone_header or write_zone_data calls between each init and complete subroutine.
4. Data stored in cell may be support in the next version.
